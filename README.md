Image generator for forum signature banners.
Setting a link to the .php in the signature would allow any other forum user to change the signature text and colour.
Background color doesn't seem to do anything.

Put these into /-fonts to make it work:
arial.ttf
arialbd.ttf
comic.ttf
comicbd.ttf
tahoma.ttf
tahomabd.ttf
verdana.ttf
verdanab.ttf
